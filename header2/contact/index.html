          <p><b>Knowledge, Health, and your connections are some of the biggest
            currencies in this world.</b> So many companies call this area home.
            It's a new concept for this area which used to be dominated by
            manufacturing and transportation.  In some cases (Volkswagen and all
            the rug companies) we still are a manufacturing hub.</p>
          <p>The Gigabit connections allowed for home to cloud working
            environments at an epic scale (that has not been capitalized upon).
             We have stopped moving high data drives from business to business
             during the day where people are now relying on file transfer
             protocol services of various types (see: MassTransit). We have only
             tapped the biginning of what is possible for this technological
             environment.</p>

                  This is a goal that I've been working toward for a long time. It's
                  quite challenging, because even if you get information and can
                  demonstrate ability, you may lose it if it is not maintained. Many
                  times, I learned some PHP and then got a long term design job and
                  lost that ability.</p>
