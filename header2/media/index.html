          <p><b>So every good story starts with the establishment of Setting.
          </b> We call Chattanooga, Gig City because this city was the first in
           the Western Hemisphere to offer 10 Gigabit Connections to all it's
           Residents and Businesses. This does not include people living in
           housing, apartments, and mobile homes in a deal to give limited
           monopolies to the cable companies (one of many examples of Crony
           Capitalism in Chattanooga, but that discussion is for another time).</p>
          <p>The Gigabit connections allowed for home to cloud working
            environments at an epic scale (that has not been capitalized upon).
             We have stopped moving high data drives from business to business
             during the day where people are now relying on file transfer
             protocol services of various types (see: MassTransit). We have only
             tapped the biginning of what is possible for this technological
             environment.</p>

                <p class="self">This is a log of my journey to become a full programmer.
                  This is a goal that I've been working toward for a long time. It's
                  quite challenging, because even if you get information and can
                  demonstrate ability, you may lose it if it is not maintained. Many
                  times, I learned some PHP and then got a long term design job and
                  lost that ability.</p>
