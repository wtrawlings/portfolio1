# Lego Planning Idea
This is an attachment to the main project. So the main project will be minimal. I will improve the theme slightly and convert the CSS on my contact set so it will look like Bootstrap design.

## LEGO-Central Casting
This is a imitation/fake business website where you are shown a company that makes Lego heads and bodies for the casting of small film projects on youtube or independent film projects. Don't have the budget to fully animate faces? Allow us to generate a full compliment of faces for each of your lego characters. Again, this is for Bodies and Heads only and it the main growth point for the business. We use two faces for each head opposite each other. This aids in the animation process, where you can open and close the mouth by just rotating the head.
